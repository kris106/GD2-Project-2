Movie Theme - non-responsive (My screen is a macbook 2015)

This project carries the theme of a movie theatre. I built an interactive space to 

simulate the feeling of trailers at the start of a movie with flashing colours, 

as the movie begins the lights turn down on the main page. When the movie 

button is clicked it moves to an empty theatre so if friends are in a group call 

it feels like sitting in the back of the movie theatre together. Finally, there 

is an article on how Covid-19 is effecting the independent movie theatre industry.
