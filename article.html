  Over the past two weeks, almost every independent, locally owned movie theater in America closed due to COVID-19, whether they were forced to by local and state governments or chose to do so in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. On paper, they’ve only shut their doors temporarily—but faced with the prospect of being shuttered for months, theaters across the country are worried they might go out of business.

        Over the past two weeks, almost every independent, locally owned movie theater in 
        America closed due to COVID-19, whether they were forced to by local and state 
        governments or chose to do so in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. 
        On paper, they’ve only shut their doors temporarily—but faced with the prospect 
        of being shuttered for months, theaters across the country are worried they might 
        go out of business.

        While indie theaters are closed, they still have to cover the cost of rent, 
        property tax, insurance, utilities, and other hard, fixed expenses. A number of 
        them are continuing to pay their employees, from full-time, salaried staffers—like 
        executive directors and programmers—to hourly workers who take tickets and 
        serve concessions.

        This is the first time many indie theaters have ever closed down, even temporarily. 
        For decades—through World War II, through 9/11—Skolnick’s theater remained open. 
        The Music Box has been in continuous operation since 1929. On Thursday, Atlanta’s 
        Plaza Theatre closed indefinitely for the first time since it opened 80 years ago. 
        And there’s no guarantee it will come back.

        Indie theaters have already started making pitches to customers to donate, become 
        members, and convert their tickets for cancelled showings into donations—but 
        when so many people are struggling financially, some are reluctant to ask for help.

        The question is whether independent theaters can survive long enough to still exist 
        by the time the coronavirus crisis ends. Some, especially those that own their 
        buildings and don’t have to pay rent, are optimistic. Others were teetering on the 
        financial brink even before this crisis began, and unless they receive a windfall 
        from the government, which is far from a guarantee, they may not make it through.

        Cineworld, the parent company of the second 
        largest chain in the U.S., is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/business/media/regal-theater-shutdown.html">closing</a> all 
        its theaters in the country, as studios keep 
        postponing releases and audiences remain 
        reluctant to return to the movies.
